WaterInMilkGlass + MilkInMilkGlass = x #each glass has x volume
WaterInWaterGlass + MilkInWaterGlass = x
WaterInMilkGlass + WaterInWaterGlass = x #x total water and x total milk across both
MilkInMilkGlass + MilkInWaterGlass = x

initially
WaterInWaterGlass = x
WaterInMilkGlass = 0
MilkInWaterGlass = 0
MilkInMilkGlass = x

trivial case:
if x = 0 then waterInWaterGlass = 0 = WaterInMilkGlass = MilkInWaterGlass = MilkInMilkGlass
trivially correct

Let's assume our statement holds for the moment and we are at the current situation
WaterInWaterGlass = x-h
WaterInMilkGlass = h
MilkInWaterGlass = h
MilkInMilkGlass = x-h

let's assume a spoon of volume r which contains 
a proportion of milk (a) and water (b)
such that 0<=a<=1, 0<=b<=1 and a+b = 1
After one spoon from MilkGlass to WaterGlass of size r
WaterInWaterGlass = x-h + b*r
MilkInWaterGlass = h + a*r
WaterInMilkGlass = h - b*r
MilkInMilkGlass = x-h - a*r

After a spoon back from WaterGlass to MilkGlass using a' and b' (proportions not necessarily as before)
WaterInWaterGlass = x-h + b*r - b'*r
MilkInWaterGlass = h + a*r - a'*r
WaterInMilkGlass = h - b*r + b'*r
MilkInMilkGlass = x-h - a*r + a'*r

simplify:
WaterInWaterGlass = x-h + r(b - b')
MilkInWaterGlass = h + r(a - a')
WaterInMilkGlass = h - r(b-b')
MilkInMilkGlass = x-h - r(a - a')
 
 Now as for our final statement that milk in water === water in milk; Is this true???
 WaterInMilkGlass ?=? MilkInWaterGlass
 h - r(b-b') ?=? h + r(a - a')
 Let's focus on the left hand side (LHS)
 LHS = h - r(b-b')
 given that a+b = 1 and a'+b' = 1, we replace all bs and b's with equivalent a and a's
 = h - r((1-a) - (1-a'))
 = h - r(1 - a - 1 + a')
the ones cancel out
 = h - r(-a + a')
take the minus sign outside the brackets
 = h + r(a - a')
the RHS (right hand side) looks like this:
h + r(a - a')
THESE ARE THE SAME!
so WaterInMilkGlass = MilkInWaterGlass at some arbitrary step where we DON'T even KNOW what the proportions
in the spoon were or the current proportions in the glasses!




ASIDE: have we lost anything?
total water remains x as
WaterInWaterGlass + WaterInMilkGlass
= x-h + r(b - b') + h - r(b-b')
= x - h + h
= x

same thing for total milk

volume in Milk glass remains x as:
WaterInWaterGlass + MilkInWaterGlass
 = x-h + r(b - b') + h + r(a - a')
 = x - h + h + r(b-b') + r(a-a')
 = x + r(b-b') + r(a-a')
 BUT we know that a+b = 1 and a' + b'  =1 HENCE
 = x + r((1-a) - (1-a')) + r(a-a')
 = x + r[ 1-a + a'-1 + a-a' ]
 = x + r[ -a + a - a' + a' ]
 = x + r[ 0 ] = x
 
 same thing for volume in Water Glass
