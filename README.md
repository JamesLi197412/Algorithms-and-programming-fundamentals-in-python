## FIT1045  Algorithms and programming fundamentals in python

## Overview
This is one of the unit I took at University. Programming fundamentals and the Python language were introduced. It covers a foundational understanding of program design and implementation of algorithms to solve simple problems. Fundamental programming control structures, built in and complex datatypes and mechanisms for modularity will be presented in Python.

Topics covered will include basic input and output, program control structures, basic data structures and modular program structure. Problem-solving strategies and techniques for algorithm development, iteration and recursion, algorithm efficiency and the limitations of algorithms will be introduced.
