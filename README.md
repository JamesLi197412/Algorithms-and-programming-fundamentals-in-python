## Algorithms and programming fundamentals in python

### Overview
This is one of the unit I took at University. Programming fundamentals and the Python language were introduced. A foundational understanding of program design is provided and algorithms are implemented to solve problems.

Topics cover basic input and output, program control (if condition, while), basic data structure (leap, stack, etc) and modular program structure. In addition, it includes problem-solving strategies and techniques for algorithm development, iteration and recursion. In the end, algorithm efficiency and the limitations of algorithms are introduced.
